In this project, we aimed to develop a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to make future transactions in the banking sector. Accurate prediction of such transactions is crucial for targeting and improving customer engagement strategies

To develop a predictive model to forecast customer transactions,where:
- 1 indicates a customer will transact in the future
- 0 indicates a customer will not transact in the future
Using a dataset with 202 columns(including traget,ID_code and var_0-var_199) and 2 lakh rows,our goal is to identify patterns and relationships that predict future customer transactions.Â¶
